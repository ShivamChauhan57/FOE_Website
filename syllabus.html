          Act professionally in the way you communicate. Treat your instructors and peers with respect, the same way as you would in a face-to-face environment. Respect other people’s ideas and be constructive when explaining your views about points you may not agree with.
          </li>
          <li>
          Be sensitive. Be respectful and sensitive when sharing your ideas and opinions. There will be people in your class with different linguistic backgrounds, political and religious beliefs, or other general differences.
          </li>
          <li>
          Proofread and check the spelling. Doing this before sending an email or posting a thread on a discussion board will allow you to make sure your message is clear and thoughtful. Avoid the use of all capital letters, it can be perceived as if you are shouting, and it is more difficult to read.
          </li>

        <h4>
          Academic Integrity:
        </h4>
        Students are expected to adhere to high standards of academic honesty and integrity, participate in class and group discussions and encourage the academic endeavors of their classmates. No form of academic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism, etc.) will be tolerated. As commonly defined, plagiarism consists of passing off as one's own the ideas, words, writings, etc., which belong to another. In accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you copy the work of another person and turn it in as your own, even if you have the permission of that person. This includes copying material from books, reports, journals, pamphlets, handouts, other publications, web sites, etc., without giving appropriate credit for those ideas and/or without identifying material as quotations when taken directly from another source. The  <a href='https://www.usf.edu/regulations-policies/' target="_blank">
         USF Policy on Academic Integrity </a>    specifies that students may not use websites that enable cheating, such as by uploading or downloading material for this purpose. This does apply specifically to CourseHero.com – any use of this website (including uploading materials) constitutes a violation of the academic integrity policy. Violation of these rules -- even unintentionally-- can result in disciplinary action including a grade penalty, up to and including an F or FF in the course, suspension, dismissal, and expulsion from USF. If you have any questions regarding plagiarism or other forms of scholastic dishonesty, please consult the relevant sections of the USF student catalogs, and/or ask the instructor. Students are strongly encouraged to complete USF's online plagiarism tutorial, which may be found at: <a href='http://www.cte.usf.edu/plagiarism/plag.html' target="_blank">

          Turnitin.com
        </h4>
        In this course, turnitin.com will be utilized. Turnitin is an automated system which instructors may use to quickly and easily compare each student's assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit all written assignments in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as instructor will receive a report from turnitin.com that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment.

        <h4>
          Disruption to Academic Progress: 
        </h4>
        Disruptive students in the academic setting hinder the educational process. Disruption of the academic process (USF Regulation 3.025) is defined as the act, words, or general conduct of a student in a classroom or other academic environment which in the reasonable estimation of the instructor: (a) directs attention away from the academic matters at hand, such as noisy distractions, persistent, disrespectful or abusive interruption of lecture, exam, academic discussion, or general University operations, or (b) presents a danger to the health, safety, or well-being of self or other persons.

        <h4>
          University Closure Policy:
        </h4>
        In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary for USF to suspend normal operations. During this time, USF may opt to continue delivery of instruction through methods that include but are not limited to: Canvas, Elluminate, Skype, and email messaging and/or an alternate schedule. It's the responsibility of the student to monitor the Canvas site for each class for course specific communication and the main USF, College, and department websites and emails for important general information.
